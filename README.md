# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Approach`

-While approaching the problem i mainly used react hooks to solve the problem of validation , i placed the validation form in a separate file to organize the validation part of the form.
-Majority of the testing was done in the dev tools in the console tab where any issue i came across i would be able to figure out the issue.
